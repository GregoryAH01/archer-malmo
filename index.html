			<h2>The Arrival</h2>
			<p>When we first arrvied, we walked in and were greeted with elevators. We had to get up a few floors, and given the size of our group, this took awhile... but we eventaully all got up there. Another thing to note that confused me initally was the the ground floor of the building was the cotton museum.</p>

			<h2>Gabe</h2>
			<p>We were now in a large room, and a Archer Malmo employee, Gabe, led our group in a q&a discussion. Gabe talked about employment at Archer Malmo. A notable thing that stood out about working at Archer Malmo is that they don't have a set number of vacation days.</p>

			<h2>Continuing the discussion...</h2>
			<p>Gabe went on to talk about the Archer Malmo workflow. He hooked his computer up to a nearby tv in the space we were in and he showed us outlines and how a project of his progresses from an sketch on a whiteboard into the final product. Gabe also went on to talk about how getting a job in a web related field dosen't have to come from a degree in web design. Gabe, for example, had studied art in college.</p>

			<h2>Moving</h2>
			<p>Soon after, we ended out q&a discussion session and Gabe took us up to the main floor of the building to see the lobby and get on the elevators to go down to their in-house studio. Going up we took the stairs, which worked out to be alot faster. However, going down we took the elevator, and this proved to take yet another while...</p>

			<h2>The Studio</h2>
			<p>We then enterend into their studio where gabe, along with a few other employees from that floor, talked to us about the space. The space is used for video as well as more experimental projects, as it is a modular space. Some of these projects include virtual reality and augmented reality projects.</p>

			<h2>The Bus</h2>
			<p>We then left Archer Malmo and walked back to where our bus was supposed to be. The problem was, our bus wasn't there. So, we wound up standing on the road waiting for them to get there. This was quite the experience...but the bus did eventaully show up to where we were and we continued on.</p>

			<h2>Cookout</h2>
			<p>After the bus getting back, and us getting back on it, we then headed to Cookout. There we ate. We secured our booth and went to order our feast. It took a few minutes to recieve the food, but upon delivery we all rushed to our booth to devour our feasts. The food was very good. A 10/10 meal proper and true.</p>

			<h2>A summary</h2>
			<p>All in all, my Archer Malmo experience was an intresting one and one to remember. Gabe discussed and covered lots of intresting information and it was intresting to hear his opinions on topics that i was already framiliar with. Archer Malmo sounds like a very intresting and cool place to work. Gabe was very knowledgable on the topics and he was very good and delievering a response that could be understood by add, but yet detailed at the same time.</p>
